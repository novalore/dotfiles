## My Dotfiles
Warning: These are quite old now, but I'm not deleting the repository just in case.

*Most of the stuff included in these configuration files have been harvested on the internet (I seldom remembered to include the source in a comment) and a minority of them are really my own, but who really cares?!*

*If you are interested in using the files or forking this repo, bear in mind that I use [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com), thus all vim-related files work as intended only if your installation include [Steve Francia](https://github.com/spf13)'s excellent distribution. If you don't use spf13-vim, have a look anyway, maybe you'll find something interesting.*
*I use also the awesome [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt). If it is present in your user's home, my bashrc will use it (have a look at install.sh).*
